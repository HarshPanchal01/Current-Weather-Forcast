# Current-Weather-Forecast

This is a web application I created to display the current weather forecast of different cities around the world.
This was also my first time using an API, so I learned how to fetch and manipulate them in code. The API I use in this project can be found at https://openweathermap.org/api.

Here is the link to the project, however since I don't want to expose my api to the public it wont be able to fetch the weather but you can take a look at the design.
